Movie Recommendation System
 a movie recommendation system is done through Content-Based Filtering method, depending on the desired complexity, data availability, and goals. Here is the approache made :

Content-Based Filtering
This system recommends movies based on characteristics (or "content") of items the user has enjoyed in the past. For movies, this could involve genre, director, actors, or keywords extracted from movie descriptions.
How It Works: The system compares the content of movies the user likes with the content of other movies, using algorithms like cosine similarity to find movies with similar features.
Example: If a user has watched several action movies with certain actors, the system will recommend similar action movies or movies featuring the same actors or directors.
